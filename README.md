# TTGO-CO2-sensor
CO2 monitor using TTGO ESP32 board, Sensirion SCD30 Sensor and Adafruit 16-LED Neopixel ring

Samples CO2, temperature and humidity every 2 seconds.

Note I normally use the FastLED library, however for this project I used the Adafruit-Neopixel library as FastLED doesn't support RGBW (Red-Green-Blue-White).
